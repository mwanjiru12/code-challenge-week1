A: greater than 80
B: between 60 and 79 
C: between 50 and 59 
D: between 40 and 49 
E: less than 40
To use the program, run the provided code in a JavaScript environment. A prompt will appear asking for the student's marks, between 0 and 100. The program will then return the corresponding grade as a letter.

Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
This program takes the speed of a car as input, and returns the number of demerit points the driver has earned, based on the following criteria:

> If the speed is less than 70, no demerit points are earned and the message "Ok" is displayed.
> For every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), the driver earns one demerit point.
> If the driver earns more than 12 demerit points, the message "License suspended" is displayed.
> To use the program, run the provided code in a JavaScript environment. A prompt will appear asking for the speed of the car, as a number. The program will then return the number of demerit points earned and/or the message "Ok" or "License suspended" based on the criteria above.

NHIF rates: <https://www.kra.go.ke/en/individual/calculate-tax/calculating-tax/payeLinks to an external site.>

To use the program, run the provided code in a JavaScript environment. The program will prompt the user to input their basic salary and benefits, as numbers. It will then return the gross salary, tax, NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, and net salary.

Project Setup
To use these programs, you will need a JavaScript environment, such as a web browser or Node.js.

To use a web browser, copy and paste the code into a .js file, and then include it in an HTML file using the <script> tag.
To use Node.js, install the Node.js runtime and ensure that you have Node.js version 10 or higher. Then, create a new directory and run npm init -y to create a new package.json file. Next, save the code to a .js file in the same directory, and run node <file>.js to execute the code.
